# Mining
Scripts n stuff for cryptomining on Ubuntu


The scripts are ones that I use on my GPU miner or the Raspberry PI v2 that is supporting the miner.  The miner runs Ubuntu 16.04 and the PI runs Noobs Debian.  All scripts are to be considered as bases for your own projects, they are likely to need editing to be of use to you. 

I take no responsibility for lost assets or broken hardware.

That said.  All scripts are free, donations are accepted and appreciated  :)
